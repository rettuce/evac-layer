# Ambient layer

What a screen shows while there is no alert: a generative scene on a canvas, with a clock and the site name on top.

## How a frame is decided

- `pickAmbient(siteKey, epochMs, pinnedSceneId?)` hashes `siteKey` and the hour slot `floor(epochMs / 3600 s)`. The hash picks the scene, the overlay corner (D21 variants A–D: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) and the scene seed. Adjacent hours never repeat a scene while more than one is registered (the base indices of the two slots are compared, so no state is kept).
- `scene.render(ctx, t, seed, shape)` is a pure function of its arguments. `t` is the clock time in ms (virtual or real), so the same `t` draws the same picture. Scenes never read `Date.now()` or `Math.random()`.
- The site key is `seed=` on `/screen` (default: the layout name) and, in live mode, the `site` query or else the municipality code.
- `/screen?…&scene=<id>` pins a scene (demo recordings). Unknown ids fall back to the hourly pick. The corner still follows `t`, so a recording that must not change picks a fixed `t` range as well.
- The root element carries `data-scene`, `data-corner` and `data-slot`.

## Overlay (after wgl ss design D21)

Values are in 720-short-side units and scaled by `min(width, height) / 720`, as in ss.

| | value |
|---|---|
| outer margin | 48 |
| track / gutter / pitch | 192 / 24 / 216 |
| block | 2 tracks (408), anchored to one corner on the outer margin |
| site name | 24 / 32 |
| time (HH:MM, JST) | 144 / 144, tabular figures |
| sweep | a 48-long segment travels the rule under the time once a minute |

The overlay is drawn on the scene's canvas (`drawOverlay`, after `scene.render`), not as DOM on top, so the frame has a single composited layer: with a DOM overlay the clock digits' edges differed by 1/255 between runs (2 of 9 captures), drawn on the canvas 9 of 9 are identical. Fonts are loaded explicitly before the first draw (`data-ready` waits for them). Vertical hairlines mark the track edges, counted from the side the block is anchored to. Ink-edge snapping (ss `inkAlign`) is not implemented, so the time's glyph edge sits a few px inside the margin.

## Scenes

| id | name | reference | what changed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `color-planes` | 色面 | the colour-plane study (direction 2, `app/shots/ambient.html`) | 3–7 soft radial planes (count by shape) on a pale ground, low saturation, each drifting on its own 90–150 s period; Canvas 2D only, so no blur filter |

To add a scene: write `scenes/<name>.ts` exporting an `AmbientScene` (`id`, `name`, `ink: 'dark' | 'light'` for the overlay colour, `render`), add it to `AMBIENT_SCENES` in `registry.ts`, and add a row here with the reference and what was changed from it.
